# 6-project-for-ML

The project is an AI learning project aimed at applying a facial image classification algorithm to determine whether an image contains a human face or not. TensorFlow library and artificial neural network are used to build and train the model on a dataset downloaded using TensorFlow Datasets.

The process is divided into several steps, starting from importing libraries and loading the data, then preparing the data for training and testing, and building the model, which is trained using the processed data. After that, the model's performance is evaluated using the test set.

The project provides a good explanation of how to build the model step by step, including assembling the layers, defining loss functions, and model updates. It also provides an analysis of the model's performance and how to improve it.

Overall, the project demonstrates the development process of an AI model for image classification in a detailed and easy-to-understand manner, providing a good understanding of the algorithm and the process in general.
